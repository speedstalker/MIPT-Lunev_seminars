1) maybe include key into entry_t and create hash_func with extrating of key
        - no, e.g. in phone book I can't delete a person if I know only his name and
                do not know the whole his profile (number and etc.)

2) calloc only one time large piece of memory, and place structure, key and entry in row,
        and point pointers to different places in these large piece of memory



*) cscope, ctags
